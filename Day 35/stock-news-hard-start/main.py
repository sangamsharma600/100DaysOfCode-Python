# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

previous_closing_rate = float(data["Time Series FX (Daily)"][day_before_yesterday]["4. close"])
rate_difference = abs(closing_rate - previous_closing_rate)
rounded_diff = f"{rate_difference:.3f}"

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator
